===================

ECMWF-RAPID Flood Prediction Tool App

This app is created to run in the Teyths programming environment.
See: https://github.com/CI-WATER/tethys

It requires you to have the ECMWF-RAPID preprocessing completed 
separately. Additionally, it can only run if you give access to the app.
